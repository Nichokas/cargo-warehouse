# cargo-warehouse
### A Rust utility that significantly reduces disk space usage and speeds up Rust builds by creating a shared cache for build artifacts across multiple projects.

## üì• Installation
```bash
cargo install cargo-warehouse
```
## üîß Usage

### Shared Cache Mode
```bash
cargo warehouse
```
This will:

- Create a .cargo-cache directory in your home folder (if it doesn't exist)
- Set up the necessary directory structure for caching
- Link your project's build directories to this centralized cache

### Single File Mode
```bash
cargo warehouse -f path/to/file.rs
```
This mode allows you to run a single Rust file without setting up a full project structure:

- Compiles and runs a standalone `.rs` file
- Supports defining dependencies within the file itself
- Perfect for quick scripts and small programs

#### Example single file format:
```rust
---cargo
[dependencies]
comfy-print = "0.3.0"
---

use comfy_print::comfy_println;
fn main() {
comfy_println!("heyy!!!!");
}
```
## üí° How It Works

In shared cache mode, the tool creates symbolic links from your project's target directory subdirectories to a centralized cache in your home directory. This means:

- Build artifacts are shared between projects
- Dependencies are compiled once and reused
- Disk space is saved by eliminating duplicate builds

In single file mode, the tool:
- Creates a temporary project structure
- Extracts cargo configuration from the file itself
- Compiles and runs the file using the standard Cargo toolchain

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
On some cases (like using windows) requires admin privileges to create symbolic links; on unix-based systems its not needed unless you dont have rw permissions.
